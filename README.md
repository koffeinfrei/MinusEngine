MinusEngine
===========
A  C# library to access [Minus API](http://minus.com/pages/api).

License

The license for this project is [Apache Software License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

It means you can pretty much do whatever you want with it IF you give back some credit.

Event handling
--------------
Every operation has two possible outputs: completion or failure.

Thus, for each operation on the class MinusEngine (which in turn represents a call to the actual Minus site) you have to register a success and failure delegate to handle these events.

The asynchronous nature of the library makes it perfect to develop UI-based applications on top of it.
